# KanaCPUParticleSystem
So I had some free over the weekend, or multiple weekends ;) and wanted to do something fun and something that test my current skillset.

So Kana was made as spiritual successor to one of my old university project.
Looking at you, young man - https://github.com/DarkRavenStar/Particle-System-for-Astran-Game-Engine.

It uses C++ 20, and some of Data-Oriented-Design principles, so not a full blown ecs-like structure

It features:

- 4 types of 2D Shape mode (Square, Circle, Stripes, Triangle) and Random between 4 shapes
- 5 types of Affector (Gravity, Speed, Scaling, Color and Rotation) to modify the particle system behaviours
- 4 types of emitter shape (Point, Square, Circle, Ring) â€“ It modifies the radius shape of the particle spawning
- Property Panel to edit and modify the particle system, 5 affectors, 3 emittor shapes and other setting.
